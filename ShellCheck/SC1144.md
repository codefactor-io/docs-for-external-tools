Pattern: Wrong use of `external-sources` directive

Issue: -

## Description

Due to its origins as an online tool, ShellCheck will by default run in a sandbox where it only reads the files explicitly named on the command line.

The `external-sources` directive allows disabling this, but must be specified in `.shellcheckrc`. This is because the sandbox would be useless if the sandboxed script can disable it for itself.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```sh
# shellcheck external-sources=true
source /dev/zero
```

Example of **correct** code:

Add `external-sources=true` to `.shellcheckrc`
